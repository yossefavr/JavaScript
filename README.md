 Some Kind of mini Java Scripts trials, 
 on the target of be able to design Fractal animations.
 
 and Github pages as well.

To run HTML files directly from GitHub in your browser,
you can use GitHub Pages, 
which allows you to host static web pages directly from a GitHub repository.
Here's how you can set it up:  

Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to the repository's Settings tab.
Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
Under the Source section, choose the branch you want to use to host the HTML files (typically main or master).
Select the folder where your HTML files are located (usually the root of the repository or a folder like /docs).
Click Save.

Access Your HTML File:
After a few minutes, your site will be live at a URL in the following format:


https://your-username.github.io/my-html-project/
For example, if your HTML file is named index.html, you can access it directly by navigating to:

https://your-username.github.io/my-html-project/index.html
That's it! 

Your HTML files are now hosted on GitHub Pages and accessible directly from your browser.
